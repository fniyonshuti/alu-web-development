I# alu-web-development - CSS Advanced

This project builds upon the completed HTML structure from the "HTML, advanced" project. I'm focusing on adding style and design using CSS to match the provided Figma design.

## Prerequisites

* **Completed HTML Structure:** Ensure you've finished all tasks in the "HTML, advanced" project. This project relies on the existing HTML structure from that project.
* **Basic CSS Knowledge:** Familiarity with CSS selectors, properties, and values is recommended.
